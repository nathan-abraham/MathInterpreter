# About
Simple math shell written in java that evaluates math expressions. Currently, it only has suport for adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, grouping (with parentheses), and exponents. Also has support for storing math expressions in variables and basic boolean logic (and, or, not, etc.). 

## Usage
Type in a math expression and press enter and you will get a returned value. You can declare a variable using this syntax ``` var name = <some expression> ```. The logical operators, and, not, and or are represented by the keywords ```and```, ```not```, and ```or```.
